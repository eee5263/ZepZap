# ZepZap

An Android Application that allows user to play mini games with other users to "conquer" landmarks around the world. 
Winning title of each landmark can only be challenged by users in that vicinity (5km) and each landmark will display
winning player's avatar (Zepeto) and username. Additionally, ZepZap allows users to store their travel itinerary images 
around landmarks, also serving the function of a travel diary.
